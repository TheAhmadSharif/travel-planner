# I think you should increase width of "trip name" because trip name can be longer and i don't want it will fit in 4-5 lines. So if you can increase width text can easily fit in one line like "trip to cebu". You can reduce width of status and Payment column.

Important note: For responsive there are many issues in responsive. It is hard for me to tell what are the issues. It is good if you can check each page on responsive mobile device. You are designer so you can understand how pages should look.
Most common issues:

There are many places text content from bottom and right. No space between 2 drop downs. pop-up doesn't scroll . Text is not proper align.</td>
